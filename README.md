 ## Phase One: Lexical Analyzer Generation using Flex
Using Flex tool to generate a lexical analyzer for a high-level source code language called "MINI-L". The lexical analyzer should take as input a MINI-L program, parse it, and output the sequence of lexical tokens associated with the program.

### Flex
  - will automatically create a C program for you (called lex.yy.c) that will perform the lexical analysis
